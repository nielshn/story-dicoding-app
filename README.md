  - Stores session data and token in `SharedPreferences`.  
  - Redirects to the main page if logged in; otherwise, displays the login page.  
- **Logout**:  
  - Clears session and token upon logout.  

### 2. List Story  
- Displays a list of stories fetched from the API with:  
  - **User Name** (R.id.tv_item_name).  
  - **User Photo** (R.id.iv_item_photo).  
- Detailed story view with:  
  - **Name** (R.id.tv_detail_name).  
  - **Photo** (R.id.iv_detail_photo).

## üåü Journey  
The journey of creating this project was deeply enriching and full of challenges. From understanding the nuances of authentication and session management to integrating modern libraries like Paging 3, every step taught valuable lessons. The most fulfilling moment was implementing **map integration** and seeing user stories come to life on a map, bridging the digital and real-world experiences.  

Crafting animations using **Shared Element Transitions** added an artistic touch, while working on **unit testing** reinforced the importance of ensuring app reliability. Through this project, the fusion of creativity and technical expertise led to a product that stands as a testament to the power of well-structured development.
